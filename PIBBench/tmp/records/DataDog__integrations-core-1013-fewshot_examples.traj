If you need the newest version of the check, install the `dd-check-nginx` package.\n24:\n25:#### NGINX status module\n26:\n27:The NGINX check pulls metrics from a local NGINX status endpoint, so your `nginx` binaries need to have been compiled with one of two NGINX status modules:\n28:\n29:* [stub status module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html) \u2013 for open source NGINX\n30:* [http status module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html) \u2013 only for NGINX Plus\n31:\n32:NGINX Plus packages _always_ include the http status module, so if you're a Plus user, skip to **Configuration** now.\n33:\n34:If you use open source NGINX, however, your instances may lack the stub status module. Verify that your `nginx` binary includes the module before proceeding to **Configuration**:\n35:\n36:```\n37:$ nginx -V 2>&1| grep -o http_stub_status_module\n38:http_stub_status_module\n39:```\n40:\n41:If the command output does not include `http_stub_status_module`, you must install an NGINX package that includes the module.

The integration appears to be designed to handle the NGINX Plus API's JSON output, which is good news for our task.\n\nThe next step is to ensure that the integration is pointed at the correct NGINX Plus API endpoint. According to the issue description, the NGINX Plus API is unified under a single endpoint. We need to update the `nginx_status_url` in the instance configuration to point to this new endpoint.\n\nSince the `nginx_status_url` is not hardcoded in the `nginx.py` file, it is likely specified in the instance configuration passed to the check method. We need to update the documentation and example configuration to reflect the new endpoint and ensure that users of the integration know to use the NGINX Plus API endpoint.\n\nDISCUSSION\nI will now edit the `README.md` file to update the configuration instructions to use the NGINX Plus API endpoint instead of the Extended Status API.\n\n"

E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[nginx] NGINX Plus extended status API depreciated; Integration needs to use Plus API instead\nNGINX R13 was just released and it replaces the Extended Status API with the NGINX Plus API.\n\n[See Announcement](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-plus-r13-released/)\n\nA future version of NGINX Plus will drop support for the Extended Status API. They are promising at least 6 months before they do so.\n\nThe Datadog integration for NGINX Plus depends on the Extended Status API (http status module).\n\nhttps://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/tree/master/nginx\n\n### Extended Status API Deprecated\nThe previous on-the-fly reconfiguration and extended status APIs are now deprecated. The deprecated APIs will continue to be shipped with NGINX Plus for a minimum of 6 months, alongside the new NGINX Plus API. After this period, the old APIs will be removed in a subsequent release of NGINX Plus.\n\n### NGINX Plus API\nNGINX Plus R13 includes a new API that is unified under one single endpoint. Previous versions of NGINX Plus included separate upstream_conf and extended status APIs. The new API combines the functionality of both, and also includes a new Key-Value Store module which brings a variety of use cases for on-the-fly reconfiguration (discussed in the next section).\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you can run code. Please think about how to install the environment from the repository directory if you need to do so.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /__Users__whilebug__Desktop__Projects__PIB-SWE-bench__PIBBench__tmp__DataDog__integrations-core-1013-fewshot_examples)\nbash-$",

See the [sample nginx.yaml](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/nginx/conf.yaml.example) for all available configuration options:\n47:\n48:```\n49:server {\n50:  listen 81;\n51:  server_name localhost;\n52:\n53:  access_log off;\n54:  allow 127.0.0.1;\n55:  deny all;\n56:\n57:  location /nginx_status {\n58:    # Choose your status module\n59:\n60:    # freely available with open source NGINX\n61:    stub_status;\n62:\n63:    # for open source NGINX < version 1.7.5\n64:    # stub_status on;\n65:\n66:    # available only with NGINX Plus\n67:    # status;\n68:  }\n69:}\n70:```\n71:\n72:NGINX Plus can also use `stub_status`, but since that module provides fewer metrics, you should use `status` if you're a Plus user.\n73:\n74:You may optionally configure HTTP basic authentication in the server block, but since the service is only listening locally, it's not necessary.\n75:\n76:Reload NGINX to enable the status endpoint. (There's no need for a full restart)\n77:\n78:#### Connect the Agent\n79:\n80:Create an `nginx.yaml` in the Agent's `conf.d` directory:\n81:\n82:```\n83:init_config:\n84:\n85:instances:\n86:  - nginx_status_url: http://localhost:81/nginx_status/\n87:  # If you configured the endpoint with HTTP basic authentication\n88:  # user: <USER>\n89:  # password: <PASSWORD>\n90:```\n91:\n92:[Restart the Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent) to start sending NGINX metrics to Datadog.\n93:\n94:### Validation\n95:\n96:[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/) and look for `nginx` under the Checks section:\n97:\n98:```\n99:  Checks\n100:  ======\n(90 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /__Users__whilebug__Desktop__Projects__PIB-SWE-bench__PIBBench__tmp__DataDog__integrations-core-1013-fewshot_examples/nginx/README.md)\n(Current directory: /__Users__whilebug__Desktop__Projects__PIB-SWE-bench__PIBBench__tmp__DataDog__integrations-core-1013-fewshot_examples)\nbash-$",
